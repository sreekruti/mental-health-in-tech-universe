#Predicting tech workers mental health condition using machine learning techniques
The rise in mental health issues and the demand for high-quality medical care have prompted research into the use of machine learning in mental health issues. 
In order to forecast mental health issues, this research presents a current thorough assessment of machine learning algorithms. 
We will also go over the difficulties, restrictions, and future directions for using machine learning in the field of mental health. 
By exploring dependable databases, we gather studies and publications on machine learning methods for forecasting mental health issue
The performance of six machine learning models is examined using logistic regression as the baseline and the f1 score as the primary indicator. 
Comparing XGBoost to Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, ADABoost and Random Forest, it is discovered that it displays the highest f1 score. Additionally, XGBoost exhibits the highest level of performance stability. The most important elements in predicting mental health disorders are identified through feature importance analysis.
The Results show that Work interference has the largest contribution. 
Whether the employee's mental health issues interfering with the work is the thing that the company should ask for its employees. Then Family history and care options(programs and benfits) provided by company is also influential in employees who want to get treatment.
For all the remaining features, there has been a little contribution.
Noticing/knowing some of these features beforehand can even help support an individual who may be experiencing a mental health issues and and connect them with the appropriate employee resources.
Companies could use the models created from this thesis to get a glimpse of the conditions affecting their employees' mental health. 
Additionally, businesses could construct intervention and evaluation prioritisation based on feature importance analysis.
Additionally, we provide concrete recommendations on the potential future research and development of applying machine learning in the mental health field.
